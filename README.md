									OOP_PROJECT

I created two classes(Buget(budget) and Person(persoana)) using aggregation. Both classes have get and set functions
for setting or returning the value of an attribute. I overloaded the following operators: +, -, +=, -, ==,  !=, <<, >>.

I also overloaded < and > for the Budget class. I created the function buget_total(total_budget) that calculates the sum
between wants and needs.

In the Person class I have the following functions: ordonare_salariu(sorts the objects of a vector according to the salary attribute)
, ordoneaza_buget(sorts the objects according to their total budget), 
castigator_loto( picks a random person as a lottery winner and sets its needs at 0 and wants at 1000000).
